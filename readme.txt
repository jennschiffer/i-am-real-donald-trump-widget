== Description ==

The I Am Real Donald Trump Widget gives you the ability to be the Real Donald Trump, or at least make it look like you tweet like him.

Installing this plugin adds the I Am Real Donald Trump Widget to your list of available widgets in the 'Widgets' submenu (which you can find under 'Appearance' in your WordPress dashboard). Adding your choice widget title and twitter handle to the widget form will make the latest Donald tweet look like it came from you. This is super important and will change your life and possibly greatly increase your S.E.O.™
